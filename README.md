# matlab-linter package

*The only deployed functionality at the moment is auto insertion
of semicolons on the correct line in Matlab files upon saving.*

If you do not like typing semicolons, this package will do it for you. If you are hoping
for more robust linter, please check back soon as the package is being worked on.


## Bugs

If you find a type of line that should not have a semicolon after it, but is not excluded,
please create a github issue for it or initiate a pull request it.
